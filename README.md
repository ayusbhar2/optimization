This is a personal project that began with the objective of cataloging the landscape of mathematical optimization and its applications to operations research.

- `applications` directory contains material for my [blog](https://ayusbhar2.github.io/) on the applications of mathematical programming and optimization theory to real world problems.
- `solver` directory contains custom (and deliberately naive) implementations of various solver subroutines along with helper classes and utility methods.
