This is a personal project that began with the objective of cataloguing the landscape of mathematical optimization and its applications to operations research. This repository contains:

- material for my blog posts on the applications of mathematical programming and optimization theory to real world problems.
- custom (and deliberately naive) implementations of various solver subroutines along with helper classes and utility methods.
